# Title
Ping-Pong
## Author
Immanuel Saina
## Description
This project is about any number which is divisible by 3, it outputs "ping" , any number which is divisible by 5, it says its "pong" and when a number is divisible by 3 and 5, it outputs that its "ping-pong".
When a user enters any number, it should list down from 1 until the number the user input..For example lets say the user inputted 10..So it will be:
1
2
ping
4
pong
ping
7
8
ping
pong
That's the way it should be.
Here is a link to my ping-pong project  https://github.com/Immanuel007/Ping-pong
